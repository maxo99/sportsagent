Generate a Python function named `generate_plot` that takes a pandas DataFrame `df` as input and returns a Plotly figure object.

Requirements:
1. The function must be named `generate_plot`.
2. It must accept a single argument `df` (pandas DataFrame).
3. It must return a Plotly figure object (e.g., from `px.bar`, `px.line`, etc.).
4. Include all necessary imports INSIDE the function (e.g., `import plotly.express as px`).
5. Do NOT use `fig.show()`.
6. Do NOT include any markdown formatting (like ```python).
7. The code should be a valid Python code block.
8. You have access to a global variable `TEAM_COLORS` which is a dictionary mapping team abbreviations (e.g., 'KC', 'BUF') to hex colors. Use this to color the chart elements by team if applicable (e.g. `color='team', color_discrete_map=TEAM_COLORS`).
9. Do NOT define `TEAM_COLORS` yourself. It is already defined in the global scope. Defining it will overwrite the complete list with your partial list.

Example structure:

def generate_plot(df):
    import plotly.express as px
    fig = px.bar(df, x='col1', y='col2')
    return fig
