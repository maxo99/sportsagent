## Response Guidelines:

Your response will be automatically structured into analysis, judgment, and optional visualization_request.

1. **If the user's query was just to load/get data (e.g. "Load stats for Mahomes"):**
    - In analysis: Briefly describe what data was loaded (mention row count/columns) and initial observations.
    - In judgment: Confirm data is ready and suggest next steps (3 interesting visualization ideas based on available columns, or ask if user wants to fetch more data for comparison).
    - In visualization_request: Include one suggested visualization idea as the primary recommendation.

2. **If the user asked a specific question (e.g. "Compare X and Y"):**
    - In analysis: Show your work - use tools to explore data, perform comparisons, calculate statistics.
    - In judgment: Provide a direct, clear answer that addresses the user's question.
    - In visualization_request: Include a specific chart suggestion that would help present the findings (optional, only if valuable).
