{"id":"sportsagent-4vt","title":"Epic: Architecture Refactoring","description":"Architecture Refactoring (High Priority)\n\n1a. Remove AnalyzerAgent Wrapper:\n- Priority: Low (no active debugging pain today; mostly a readability/maintainability refactor).\n- Status (as of 2026-01-07): Not completed. analyzer_node still instantiates AnalyzerAgent.\n- Current state (important nuance): AnalyzerAgent is a thin wrapper around BaseAgent.create() which uses langchain.agents.create_agent(...). There isn't a big custom analyzer graph hidden here; removing the wrapper primarily reduces indirection.\n- Potential benefits (why/when to do it):\n  - Make the analyzer call path easier to trace end-to-end (node -\u003e wrapper -\u003e base agent -\u003e create_agent).\n  - Simplify patching/mocking by relying on a function/module seam instead of a class (if you later standardize agent construction across nodes).\n  - Reduce duplication between wrapper \"getter\" methods and node logic (trace/tool-call/message extraction).\n- Risks / cost:\n  - Rework unit tests that currently patch AnalyzerAgent directly.\n  - If done naively, can increase coupling in analyzernode.py (more code in one place).\n- Suggested scope (keep it small if ever done):\n  - Prefer extracting a module-level factory like create_analyzer_agent() (or create_analyzer_graph()) and keeping analyzernode.py orchestration-focused.\n  - Treat this as preparatory only if you're about to do 1b or broader refactors.\n- Acceptance criteria (if pursued):\n  - Analyzer behavior unchanged: tool-call detection (request_more_data), trace capture, and final message handling still work.\n  - Workflow node key/name (AnalyzerReactAgent) and routing behavior unchanged.\n  - Tests updated to patch the new seam and still pass.\n\n1b. Refine Structured Output:\n- Status (as of 2026-01-07): Not completed for the analyzer.\n  - The query parser already uses structured output (ParsedQuery) and sets state.needs_visualization from parsed_query.wants_visualization.\n  - The analyzer still produces freeform text (state.generated_response = ai_message) and does not emit a typed/validated structure.\n- Goal: Make analyzer output more reliable for downstream decisions (report vs. request-more-data vs. visualization) by separating:\n  - analysis: supporting reasoning / calculations / observations\n  - judgment: the direct user-facing answer / conclusion\n  - visualization_request: explicit chart intent for reporting only (does not drive state.needs_visualization)\n- Why this might matter:\n  - Reduces reliance on brittle phrase heuristics (today analyzer uses string detection for REQUEST_MORE_DATA:; visualization intent is primarily driven by parser).\n  - Makes reports more consistent (clear \"answer\" section vs. scratch-work).\n- Suggested minimal approach (low risk):\n  - Enforce headings/markers in the analyzer prompt template (e.g., require ## Judgment and ## Visualization Request) and parse them into state fields.\n- Non-goals:\n  - Avoid verbose fallbacks that bloat the codebase. If parsing the structured sections fails, treat the analyzer output as plain text for reporting rather than attempting multi-step recovery.\n- Dependencies / ordering:\n  - Independent of 1a now (since 1a is low priority). If you ever do 1a, it can make 1b wiring cleaner, but it's not a blocker.\n  - Visualization intent remains authoritative from the parser (ParsedQuery.wants_visualization); analyzer visualization_request is informational/reporting only.\n- Effort (T-shirt):\n  - S/M for \"prompt headings + parsing into state\".\n  - M if you also refactor reporting to render sections separately.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-07T10:05:32.237535291-05:00","created_by":"maxo","updated_at":"2026-01-08T07:55:57.660499404-05:00"}

Runtime Configuration:\n- Status (as of 2026-01-07): Partially implemented.\n  - ASSET_OUTPUT_DIR is supported via env and the Dockerfile sets ASSET_OUTPUT_DIR=/app/data/outputs.\n  - Settings also include API_HOST, API_PORT, AUTO_APPROVE_DEFAULT, and SAVE_ASSETS_DEFAULT.\n- Goal: Make runtime knobs consistent across local runs, container runs, CLI, and API.\n- Scope (remaining):\n  - Ensure just run-api/CLI/API use settings.API_HOST/settings.API_PORT (or clearly document if they intentionally don't).\n  - Ensure defaults are documented (env vars + behavior).\n- Acceptance criteria:\n  - Running API honors configured host/port and asset output dir.\n  - CLI defaults (--auto-approve, --save-assets-to-file) align with settings and are overrideable.\n- Effort (T-shirt): S.\n\n4c. Entrypoint Flexibility:\n- Status (as of 2026-01-07): Not implemented. Docker image currently always starts the API (uvicorn sportsagent.api:app).\n- Goal: Support selecting API vs CLI behavior in container/runtime without rebuilding images.\n- Scope (minimal):\n  - Add a small entrypoint shim that starts API by default but can run the CLI when configured (env/arg).\n- Acceptance criteria:\n  - Default behavior remains API.\n  - A documented env/arg switches to CLI mode.\n- Effort (T-shirt): S/M.\n\n4d. Manual Validation Path:\n- Keep a short list of manual smokes:\n  - CLI: auto-approve + assets saved to ASSET_OUTPUT_DIR.\n  - API: happy-path via test.http.\n  - Container: run with persisted artifacts (bind mount or named volume) so reports/charts survive container removal (e.g., -v $(pwd)/data/outputs:/app/data/outputs).\n\n4e. Session/Backing Store:\n- Goal: Persist session state in the future (conversation history / workflow checkpoints), independent of artifact persistence.\n- Note: Even with a session backing store, artifact persistence still needs a volume/bind mount (or a separate external artifact store).\n- Scope (minimal): keep the in-memory store abstracted and document the swap path to an external store.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-07T10:05:32.268514253-05:00","created_by":"maxo","updated_at":"2026-01-08T07:56:17.739469853-05:00"}
